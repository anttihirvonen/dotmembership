# Use DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE as environment variable
# to control which settings get loaded.

# You can put environment variables in env-directory
# on project root which automatically get loaded
# by manage.py in development. In production,
# envdir (from daemontools package) or it's Python port
# can be used to load configuration variables.
